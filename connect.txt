Download ConnectorJ from this link https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

extract folder into the same folder as CS4370_PROJ2 (not INSIDE of it but same dir as it.)

Always include the mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar in the compile & run path
if mysql-connector-j.9.0.0 is in folder with CS4370_PROJ2, compile command for test file should be:

Before trying to compile make sure that the database is set up and that you have changed 
the jdbc, username, and password variables in MySQLConnector.java to match your Workbench config.

Note that we may have different username &/ password, so always double check when pulling from main that it matches your database.
You also need to turn on your database. In workbench, go to Database tab -> Connect to Database -> then go to server tab (Server -> Server Status), ensure server is running.


Proceed once above is complete:

Compile:

javac -cp ..\mysql-connector-j.9.0.0\mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar .\src\MySQLConnector.java (from cd path\to\cs4370_proj2) (mac may have \ flipped to / can't remember)

Run:

java -cp ..\mysql-connector-j.9.0.0\mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar .\src\MySQLConnector.java

Output should be "Connection successful!"
